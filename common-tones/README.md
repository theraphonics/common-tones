common-tones


This is common-tones, a sound synthesis package documented in common-tones.html. 
common-tones is a fork of CLM, originally written by Bill Schottstaedt. (See COPYING.md)

We are in the middle of rebranding the library. Docs still reference clm and the library doesn't load correctly yet.
